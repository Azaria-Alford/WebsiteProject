			Since I’ve started this journey I’ve been recording mostly every part of it when I first got my tattoo kit to my first time doing a stencil to my first time actually tattooing somebody. I’ve been practicing tattooing since the beginning of this year January 2021 and I would like to say I have shown a lot of progress throughout this time. In this photo right here you can see my first stencils I’ve made of course I wasn’t good at first but it doesn’t mean that I was going to give up. After getting a lot better with the stencils I learned how to put the stencils on practice skin which is like a alternative to real skin without using an actual person. Although real skin and face skin or different textures. 
When practicing on fake skin it became a little difficult because trying to work with the ink and the fake scam was sometimes hard to get the leftover ink off of the work space. After spending many weeks of practicing on practice can I have the confidence to move on to Real skin!

			<p>In March, I did my first tattoo on an actual client they wanted something simple completely blacked out and it was really fun but kind of awful difficult as well because they wanted their piece is completely blacked out and I’ve never done that before. I actually didn’t turn out that bad. Since then I’ve given myself three tattoos and at least seven tattoos on different people.</p>
