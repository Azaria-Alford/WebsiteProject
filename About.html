<article class="right"><p>I’ve been always into art and design and expressing myself‘s from a young age. I was always getting my hands on something like a pencil or a paintbrush and painting or drawing on anything I could find. In the past, I have painted on regular canvases to shoe to shoeboxes. When I was younger I remember watching ink masters with my dad. It has always been one of my favorite moment to share with my dad every time it comes on because we are both into art and different kind of art styles. To this day we still watch it together. So when I got older I really wanted to be a tattoo artist when I realize I can leave my artwork on somebody permanently. Earlier this year I decided to get serious about that idea and got my first tattoo kit in January. Since then I’ve been trying to better myself and learn all the skills possible.</p>
	<p>The purpose of this website is to show that anyone and everyone can become a tattoo artist or start tattooing as a hobby if they really put the effort into it. People should be able to have the ability to learn how to tattoo And learn about theand learn about the art form and you art and resources that they can find. As well as be provided with more information about tattooing.  Of course when starting to tattoo it’s best to do it under supervision of a trained tattoo artist and a clean environment. Tattoo Novice™ DOES NOT encourage others to tattoo people without the proper training and supervision.</p>
